##Hangman game

This is my version of the classic Hangman game.

This app parses .txt dictionary data, masking the computer chosen word while giving the user a chance to guess the word, letter by letter. It displays a graphical hangman that progressively reveals limbs as incorrect guesses are made. 

It also uses YAML serialization to allow the user to save progress and load previous games, beginning where they left off.
